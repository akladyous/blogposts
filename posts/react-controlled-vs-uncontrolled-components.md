# React Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components

![Alt text](/images/react-controlled-vs-uncontrolled-components.png)

## React makes it easy to manipulate data using forms.

One of the most common patterns you‚Äôll see in React when dealing with forms is that we need to make
React aware of changes to the form inputs when the user types. This means that the component
containing those input elements typically needs to keep track of the text in the input elements
using state.

React supports two types of components: controlled components and uncontrolled components. Let‚Äôs
uncover the main differences between controlled and uncontrolled components.

## Controlled Component

Unlike the uncontrolled component, the input form element in the controlled component is handled by
the component rather than the DOM. It takes its current value through props. The changes are
notified through useState Hook. Let‚Äôs consider an example to understand it in a better way.

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';
export default function ControlledComponent() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [age, setAge] = useState();
  const [hairColor, setHairColor] = useState('');
  return (
    <form>
      <label htmlFor='name'>
        Name
        <input
          name='name'
          type='text'
          placeholder='Name'
          value={name}
          onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <label htmlFor='age'>
        Age
        <input
          name='age'
          type='number'
          placeholder='Age'
          value={age}
          onChange={(e) => setAge(Number(e.target.value))}
        />
      </label>
      <label htmlFor='haircolor'>
        Hair Color
        <input
          name='haircolor'
          type='text'
          placeholder='Hair Color'
          value={hairColor}
          onChange={(e) => setHairColor(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

The input field is Controlled because React sets its value from the state.

```js
<input value={value} />
```

Whenever we type into the input field, the onChange handler updates the state with the input‚Äôs value
accessed from the event object. The value state variable is the source of truth. When we need to
access the value entered by the user into the input field, we have to read the value from the state
variable. The Controlled components can help access the value of any input field.

## Uncontrolled component

Similar to the traditional HTML form inputs, the uncontrolled component can be written using a ref
to get form values from the DOM. Thus there is no need to write an event handler for every state
update and the HTML elements maintain their own state that will be updated when the input value
changes.

```ts
import { createRef } from 'react';
export default function UncontrolledComponent() {
  const nameInput = createRef();
  const ageInput = createRef();
  const hairColorInput = createRef();
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log(nameInput.current.value);
    console.log(ageInput.current.value);
    console.log(hairColorInput.current.value);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <label htmlFor='name'>
          Name
          <input name='name' type='text' placeholder='Name' ref={nameInput} />
        </label>
        <label htmlFor='age'>
          Age
          <input name='age' type='number' placeholder='Age' ref={ageInput} />
        </label>
        <label htmlFor='haircolor'>
          Hair Color
          <input name='haircolor' type='text' placeholder='Hair Color' ref={hairColorInput} />
        </label>
        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Both the controlled and uncontrolled form fields have their merit. Evaluate your specific situation
and pick the approach ‚Äî what works for you is good enough.
